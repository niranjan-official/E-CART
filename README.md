# E-CART
My first Full-Stack project(MongoDb, Express, Handlebars, Nodejs).
Done with the help of Brototype[yt channel]
Its an E-commerce website where people can buy and sell products.
For adding admin you can use the commented admin-signup function in routes/admin.js.
The admin-signup page is commented since the admin page should not be accessed bty normal users.
